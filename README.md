# Guess the Word Game

This is a simple text-based game written in Python where you have to guess a word by suggesting one letter at a time. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word. If you guess incorrectly, the number of attempts decreases.

## How to Play:
1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. You must guess one letter at a time.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position.
4. If the letter is not in the word, you lose one attempt.
5. You have 6 attempts to guess the word. 
6. The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
